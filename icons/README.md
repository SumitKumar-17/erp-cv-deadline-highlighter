# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For a deadline highlighter extension, consider using:
- Clock/timer icon
- Calendar with highlights
- Colorful deadline indicator
- Graduation cap (for academic context)

Recommended colors:
- Primary: #4CAF50 (Green)
- Secondary: #FF9800 (Orange)
- Accent: #F44336 (Red)

The icons should be professional and clearly represent the extension's purpose.
